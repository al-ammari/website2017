Using commonly available IP address lookup services, any of these can determine your approximate location. These service providers can also capture your communications, and are largely unfettered in using it for their own purposes. They can also secretly hand it over to third parties, including law enforcement and security agencies. With IXmaps, we only use your IP address only to produce these maps and then anonymize it.
