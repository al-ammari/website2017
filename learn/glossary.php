        <dt>Autonomous System Number (ASN)</dt>
            <dd>An Autonomous System Number (ASN) is a uniquely assigned number of an Autonomous System (AS), which is a collection of connected Internet Protocol (IP) routing prefixes under the control of network operator(s) with a common, clearly-defined, internet routing policy. ASNs are important because they uniquely identify each network and hence ISP/carrier on the Internet. For more, see Autonomous System</dd>
        <dt>Boomerang Routing</dt>
            <dd>Boomerang routing refers to internet routing where a data path starts and ends in the same country (e.g. Canada) but passes through another country (e.g. the US) before returning.</dd>
        <dt>Five Eyes</dt>
            <dd>Five Eyes is an alliance for sharing intelligence between Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States based on the UKUSA multilateral cooperation agreement. For more, see Five Eyes</dd>
        <dt>Hop</dt>
            <dd>A hop represents one portion of the path between a communication source and its destination. As data is transmitted along a path it passes through routers and other devices. Each device passing data to the next constitutes  a hop. For more, see hop</dd>
        <dt>Hostname </dt>
            <dd>An internet hostname is a human-readable nickname that corresponds to the IP address of a device connected to a network (e.g. IXmaps.ca). Hostnames appear as a component in Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) for internet resources such as web sites (e.g. https://IXmaps.ca). For more, see hostname</dd>
        <dt>Internet</dt>
            <dd>The internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that share common rules or protocols for linking devices worldwide, passing data between networks, and delivering it to the intended destinations. Mainly, the internet physically consists of high capacity fibreoptic cables connected to each other via routers located in internet switching centres or exchanges. For more, see Internet</dd>
        <dt>Internet Service Provider (ISP) or Carrier</dt>
            <dd>An internet service provider (ISP) or carrier, is a telecommunication company that offers various internet communications services, including access to the internet. ISPs, by necessity, have access to all the personal information they handle, and under Canadian law have privacy responsibilities. They are also subject to requests for access to this information from intelligence and law enforcement agencies, as well as other third parties such as copyright holders. For more, see internet service provider</dd>
        <dt>Internet Exchange or Switching Site</dt>
            <dd>An internet exchange or switching site is physical infrastructure through which ISPs or carriers exchange internet traffic between their networks. Typically located in large buildings in the centre of major cities, they are connected with other exchanges by high-speed fibre optic cables. They also provide connections for local internet services and subscribers. For more, see internet exchange point</dd>
        <dt>IP Address</dt>
            <dd>An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each device communicating on a computer network . IP addresses are used for interface identification and location addressing. They are often displayed as a series of numbers separated by a “.” or “:” (e.g. the IP address for the IXmaps.ca site is 128.100.72.189). For more, see IP address</dd>
        <dt>Latency</dt>
            <dd>In networks, latency refers to the length of time or delay, usually measured in milliseconds (ms), it takes for data to travel between two points in a network (including the internet). A low latency connection features short delay times, while a high latency connection suffers from long delays. Operating systems have software programs that measure latency, including ping and traceroute. Tracerouting programs often send multiple packets to the same IP address in an attempt to correct for random variations. Minimum latency refers to the length of time that the fastest packet took to reach a node and return. For more, see network latency</dd>
        <dt>National Security Agency (NSA)</dt>
            <dd>The National Security Agency (NSA) is an intelligence organization of the United States government, responsible for global monitoring, collection, and processing of information and data for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes, a discipline known as signals intelligence (SIGINT). NSA is concurrently charged with protection of U.S. government communications and information systems against penetration and network warfare. For more, see National Security Agency</dd>
        <dt>NSA surveillance sites</dt>
            <dd>The NSA, is strongly suspected of having installed, without judical warrants, surveillance ‘splitter rooms’ in 15-20 major internet exchange points across the country. Former AT&T technician Mark Klein claims that several internet service providers (ISPs) in the United States have allowed the NSA to install devices which mirror all traffic passing through selected routers. This mirrored data is then inspected by Narus computers and selectively routed back to NSA data centres for further analysis and storage. Klein has described in detail a 'secret spy room" at 611 Folsom St. in San Francisco–Room 641A–and indicates there are other such rooms in Los Angeles, San Diego, Seattle, San Jose and Atlanta (see his book Wiring Up The Big Brother Machine... And Fighting It, p. 98).  View these suspected NSA splitter locations on the Map page</dd>
        <dt>Packet (or Data Packet)</dt>
            <dd>All internet communication involves packets; every web page you visit arrives as a series of packets and every email you send leaves as a series of packets. A data packet is typically forwarded from one router to another in a series of "hops" through the networks that constitute the internet until it reaches its destination node. In order to recreate the original message, packets are re-assembled at the destination. For more, see network packet</dd>
        <dt>PRISM surveillance program</dt>
            <dd>PRISM is a clandestine surveillance program under which the NSA collects internet communications from at least nine major US internet companies–Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, Paltalk, YouTube, Skype, AOL and Apple. For more, see PRISM</dd>
        <dt>Router</dt>
            <dd>A router is a physical device that forwards data packets across and between computer networks. Routers direct traffic" on the internet. Each router belongs to a particular ISP or carrier, which assigns it a unique internet protocol (IP) address and often a hostname that identifies the type of router and its physical location. For more, see router</dd>
        <dt>Target Sites (or trsets)</dt>
            <dd>IXmaps uses sets of target sites, or trsets, to run traceroutes in the IXmaps Client. These groups of websites include Canadian public, education, legal, media and financial entities, as well as internationally popular or significant websites or webservers (including Google’s Public DNS, or name servers).  ?? You can view our trsets:See ixmaps.ca/trsetshttps://www.ixmaps.ca/trsets</dd>
        <dt>Traceroute</dt>
            <dd>A traceroute is a measurement of the path and transit times of data traveling across the internet depicted as a series of hops from one router to the next. Traceroutes can be generated to particular destination internet protocol (IP) addresses or hostnames by software programs. IXmaps uses a modified version of this software to enable the traceroute data generated to be stored in the IXmaps database from where it can be mapped. For more, see traceroute</dd>
        <dt>Upstream surveillance programs</dt>
            <dd>NSA upstream surveillance programs refer to the interception of communication traffic from the internet backbone–or major internet switches or exchanges, and cables, while the data is in transit. This enables the capture of all forms of internet communications -  e.g. emails, text chats, web searches, downloads, voice over IP (VoIP) calls (e.g. Skype), and even video chat sessions. Along with the PRISM program, they are part of what NSA Director Gen. Keith Alexander called a "collect it all" surveillance approach (The crux of the NSA story in one phrase: 'collect it all', by Glenn Greenwald, Guardian, July 15, 2013, drawing on For NSA chief, terrorist threat drives passion to ‘collect it all’, by Ellen Nakashima and Joby Warrick, Washington Post, July 14, 2013). For more, see upstream collection</dd>
        <dt>Geoprecision ??</dt>
            <dd>Pinpointing the physical location of a router is difficult. When talking about a location, the IXmaps uses the term geoprecision to describe the level of accuracy precision with which geolocation, or pinpointing the physical location of a router, has been ascribed. IFor example, if geoprecision is to 'building level', we believe we arecan saying with some confidence that the router is located within a specific building. If geoprecision is ‘city level’More often, however, we are only confident that our geolocation is accurate to aat a 'city level'. If geoprecision is ‘maxmind’, Finally, a geoprecision of 'Maxmind' indicates that we are relying on Maxmind’s their geolocation.</dd>
        <dt>Network sovereignty</dt>
            <dd>Network sovereignty is the concept of national sovereignty applied to communications and other networks. It draws directly from the longstanding recognition that nation states have the right and duty to exercise superordinate control within their borders over all matters pertaining to the public good and to negotiate with other states on the basis of equality. In the internet context, it refers to the ability of a nation to exercise effective control over its own critical internet infrastructure. While iIt can serve a wide variety of national aims, when consistent with international human rights law and the integrity of the internet as a unified open global communication medium, network sovereignty can contribute to protecting privacy, promoting more efficient routing and producing economic benefits. For more, see network sovereignty</dd>
        <dt>Privacy andrequirements under Canadian law</dt>
            <dd>In Canada there are two Federal privacy laws: the Privacy Act, which covers how the government handles personal information, and Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), which covers how the private-sector can handle personal information.</dd>
