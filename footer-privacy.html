            <p>This privacy policy outlines how we may collect your personal data as a visitor to our website. Through the IXmaps website and IXmapsClient traceroute generation software, we collect the following information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>E-mail addresses from those who send inquiries to the project. We will not share, sell, or distribute your e-mail address.</li>
                <li>Anonymous uUsage statistics on our Web pages, page downloads, and search engine queries. For this we use Piwik open-source, privacy-compliant web analytics</li>
                <li>If you contribute to traceroutes, we anonymize your IP address by turning the last three digits, or octet, into zeroes. (e.g. 123.123.123.123 becomes> 123.123.123.000)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You may contact us at any time to correct or change any personal data that we hold about you (for example, if you want to change your username). You may also ask to have all data related to your activity removed from our system. To do so, please email us.</p>
            <p>In the highly unlikely event that we receive a request for any personal information, we will make best efforts to notify those who may be affected. We will resist such a request without prior explicit approval of those whose data is requested. So far we have not received any such request.</p>
            <p>This site is governed by the privacy policies of the University of Toronto, and hence Ontario's Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA).</p>
